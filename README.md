# Asteroids

Asteroids is a classic arcade-style game built using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a triangle-shaped spaceship, avoiding and destroying asteroids to survive as long as possible.

## Features

- **Single-player Gameplay**: Control the spaceship and navigate through a field of asteroids.
- **Asteroid Splitting**: Large asteroids split into smaller ones when shot, continuing to divide until they disappear upon reaching their minimum size.
- **Random Respawning**: Asteroids respawn at random locations, increasing the challenge.
- **Shooting Mechanics**: Destroy asteroids using the spaceship's shooting capability.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**:
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate the spaceship.
   - Press the spacebar to shoot.
2. **Objective**:
   - Avoid collisions with asteroids.
   - Shoot and destroy asteroids to earn points.
   - Survive as long as possible!
